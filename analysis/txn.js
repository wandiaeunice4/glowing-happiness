/**
 * EVIE — the transactions panel.
 *
 * The same account of a session Deriv's own run panel keeps: every contract as
 * a row of type, the two spots it settled between, and what it cost against
 * what it made — then the totals underneath.
 *
 * Two of those totals are easy to get wrong.
 *
 *   Total payout is what came BACK, not what was staked plus profit. A losing
 *   contract returns nothing at all, so it contributes 0 — otherwise a run of
 *   losses would still show a growing payout, which is nonsense.
 *
 *   Total profit/loss is payout minus stake, and falls out of the other two
 *   rather than being summed separately, so the three can never disagree.
 *
 * On a wide screen it is a rail down the right. On a narrow one it becomes a
 * sheet that rises from the bottom, because the rail would eat half the width
 * a market card needs.
