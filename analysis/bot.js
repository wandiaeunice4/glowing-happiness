/**
 * EVIE — the floating bot.
 *
 * Does by itself exactly what the cards let a person do by hand, and nothing
 * more: it reads the same percentages, and places trades through the same
 * function the buttons call.
 *
 * Choosing a PAIR rather than a side is the point. Told "Even/Odd", it looks at
 * the market immediately before every trade and takes whichever of the two is
 * ahead — so a run that starts on Even follows the market onto Odd if that is
 * where the edge went. The check happens before each trade, never once at the
 * start.
 *
 * Two rules keep it steady, and both were learned from it not being:
 *
 *   Its figures come from the TRANSACTIONS LEDGER, not from a tally it keeps
 *   as it goes. A separate count can miss a result — and then it reports a
 *   loss the ledger already shows recovered.
 *
 *   Every start takes the next GENERATION number, and only the loop holding
 *   the current one may touch the panel. A run still unwinding can therefore
 *   never switch off a run that has just begun, which is how the card came to
 *   read "Stop" with nothing running behind it.
 *
 * When it stops:
 *
 *   Take profit reached   → stop, in front.
 *   Stop loss reached     → stop, and this one overrides everything below. It
 *                           is the number set to be protected by, so a
 *                           martingale ladder does not get to overrule it.
 *   Neither set, in front → stop; the ladder has recovered.
 *   Neither set, behind   → keep going, staking up, until it is in front.

   *
   * Differs carries the highest percentage on the card and the smallest payout
   * on Deriv — about nine per cent, because it wins nine times in ten. Put a
   * 3.1x martingale behind that and a winning trade returns roughly a quarter

   *
   * So after a loss on Matches/Differs, NEITHER side of that pair is a
   * candidate. The highest percentage among everything else takes the trade.
   * After a win the pair comes straight back, which is what was chosen and
   * what the analysis favours.
   *
   * A recovery STAYS on the type it opened with until it wins. The percentages
   * move a little with every tick, so re-deciding each time would hop between
   * types that are within a point of each other in the middle of a martingale
   * ladder — three trades into a recovery on three different contracts, none
