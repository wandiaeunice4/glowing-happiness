/**
 * EVIE — recovery drills for the Eviematic Ai simulation.
 *
 * With losses set to none, nothing loses. The bot then spends the whole
 * session on Differs at the base stake and never once shows the thing it is
 * actually built around: the recovery. Stake stepped up by the martingale,
 * Over 4 or Under 5 on the market whose digits are leaning that way, and the
 * ladder cleared by a win.
 *
 * So the drill STARTS a recovery instead of provoking one. Every so often,
 * after a winning trade, the bot is put into recovery mode with the stake the
 * martingale would have set. Its own code does the rest — it picks the side
 * from the digit counts, buys Over or Under at that stake, and leaves recovery
 * on the win. Single or double, on a coin flip: a double runs the second rung
 * at the multiplier again, which is what the ladder climbing actually looks
 * like.
 *
 * Nothing about the result is faked. Every trade shown was placed by the real
 * engine, at the stake and on the contract the ledger says, and won on a real
 * tick. The only thing injected is the DECISION to escalate — which in a live
 * session a loss would have made.
 *
 * This file exists only in the simulation. The engine has no idea it is here:
 * it is handed the same state a loss would have left behind.
