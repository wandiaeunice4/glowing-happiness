/**
 * EVIE — the simulation's front door.
 *
 * Two jobs, in order.
 *
 * First it collects the conditions: the balance to start with, whether losses
 * come in a run, at random or not at all, how many, and whether the very first
 * trade loses. Those are written where fake-deriv.js reads them.
 *
 * Then — and only then — it loads the analysis page's own scripts. Holding
 * them back matters: app.js opens a socket and starts subscribing the moment
 * it runs, and a balance chosen after the first tick has already landed is a
 * balance applied to a simulation that has already begun. Nothing starts until
 * the conditions are set.
 *
 * Restarting is a reload. The plan lives in the session, so reloading with the
 * card open is the honest way to begin again from a known state, and closing
 * the tab clears it like everything else here.
