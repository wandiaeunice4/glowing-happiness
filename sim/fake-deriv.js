/**
 * EVIE — the simulator's Deriv.
 *
 * The simulation is NOT a second copy of the analysis page. analyss.html loads
 * the very same app.js, bot.js, session.js, txn.js and analyser.js the real
 * page does; the only thing swapped underneath them is this file, which stands
 * in for deriv.js and for the WebSocket it would have opened.
 *
 * That is the whole design. A forked page would drift from the real one within
 * a week and would prove nothing about it. A fake server cannot drift: if a
 * trade works here, the same code made it work.
 *
 * ── How an outcome is arranged ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The honest way, and the only one that keeps the screen consistent with
 * itself: the sim does not decide "you lost" and then write a losing number in
 * the ledger. It decides which side should win, and then CHOOSES THE SETTLING
 * TICK so that the contract genuinely settles that way.
 *
 * A scripted loss on Even really does land on an odd digit. That digit goes
 * into the same stream the analysis panel is reading, so the percentages, the
 * digit grid, the entry and exit spots and the transaction all agree — exactly
 * as they would if Deriv had sent it. Nothing on screen has to be special-
 * cased, because nothing on screen is being lied to.
 *
 * Prices are otherwise a plain random walk per symbol, at the same tick a
 * second the real feed runs at and with each index's own decimal places.
 *
 * ── The payout ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One formula rather than a table: a fair payout is stake / probability, and
 * the house keeps a slice. At a 2.5% edge that lands on 1.95x for Even/Odd and
 * Rise/Fall, ~9.75x for Matches and ~1.08x for Differs — close enough to
 * Deriv's real board for a recovery ladder to behave the way it will live.
