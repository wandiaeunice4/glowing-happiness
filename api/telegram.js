/**
 * The support bot, and the way back to the person who asked.
 *
 * Support messages arrive in Telegram. To answer one, swipe-reply to it: the
 * reply is delivered to that visitor in the support bubble on the site, usually
 * within seconds. Telegram tells us which message was replied to, and that id
 * is what identifies the visitor — so the swipe is not a nicety, it IS the
 * addressing. A message typed into the chat without replying to anything has no
 * recipient, and the bot says so rather than swallowing it.
 *
 * Telegram posts here from the open internet, so the shared secret it was
 * registered with is checked on every call, and only the owner's own chat is
 * listened to at all.
