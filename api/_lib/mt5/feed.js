/**
 * EVIE MT5 — where the candles come from.
 *
 * Straight from Deriv, over their public market-data socket. Market data needs
 * no token and no account, which is why this page works for somebody who has
 * never connected one.
 *
 * Every symbol goes down a SINGLE socket. Deriv answers each request with the
 * `req_id` it was asked with, so one connection can carry the whole basket at
 * once and the replies still sort themselves out. Opening the socket costs
 * about a second; the thirty-odd histories that follow cost under two more.
 * Doing it a symbol at a time, or a category at a time, would spend that first
 * second over and over for nothing.
 *
 * This runs in Node, where WebSocket has been part of the language runtime
 * since Node 22 — so there is no dependency here, and nothing to install.
