/**
 * SOMEBODY ASKING FOR THE EVIE MT5 EA.
 *
 * The form on the bot's page collects a client or MT5 ID, a name and an email.
 * This records it, then posts it into Telegram THROUGH THE SUPPORT PIPE rather
 * than as its own kind of notification — so it arrives in the same chat as
 * everything else, carries the conversation this person has already had, and
 * is answered the same way: /approve or /decline, handled in the webhook.
 * Everything the person sees afterwards happens in the support bubble.
 *
 * Whatever they paste is taken as the ID. Client IDs are not all one shape,
 * and an ID guessed at by a regex is an ID refused from somebody holding the
 * real thing. A wrong one simply gets declined, which is a reply, not a wall.
