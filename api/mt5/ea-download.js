/**
 * The Evie MT5 EA, to somebody holding a code that was issued to them.
 *
 * The file does not sit under the site root, because a file there is a link
 * anybody can share, and gating the BUTTON would change nothing at all. It is
 * bundled beside this function (vercel.json includeFiles) and this route is the
 * only way to it.
 *
 * The code is checked against the browser that asked for it, not just against
 * the list of valid codes: an approved code that worked for whoever it was
 * forwarded to would put the file back where it started within a week.
