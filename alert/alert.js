/**
 * EVIE — the take profit / stop loss card.
 *
 * Both bots already knew when a run had hit a target the user typed in; they
 * said so in a status line and stopped. But the person who set a take profit
 * is, by definition, not watching — that is what setting one is for — so the
 * one moment worth interrupting for was the one that whispered.
 *
 * It fires on exactly two outcomes:
 *
 *   take profit  a run that reached the target. Congratulations, and the
 *                figures, and nothing else: they got what they asked for.
 *   stop loss    a run that reached the limit. No congratulations, and no
 *                dressing it up — one piece of advice they can act on next
 *                run, which is to come back down to the minimum stake.
 *
 * Neither fires unless the user SET that target. A run that ends any other way
 * — stopped by hand, recovered, refused — says so in the status line as it
 * always did. This is not a general notifier.
 *
 * The name on the API is PopupNotifications because that is what the Automatic
 * AI engine already calls, on the two lines it was carrying from the platform
 * it was written for. Those calls have been dead here for want of this file.
