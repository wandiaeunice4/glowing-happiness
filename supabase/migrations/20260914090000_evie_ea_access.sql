-- MT5 EA ACCESS — who asked, who was approved, and the code that lets them in.
--
-- The Evie MT5 Expert Advisor is free, but it is only for the Evie trading
-- community: it takes its signals from our own engine, and that is
-- shared with people who came to Deriv through us rather than with anyone who
-- finds the page. So the file is not a public download; it is a request.
--
-- The shape of it: somebody enters their client or MT5 ID, a name and an
-- email. That arrives in Telegram through the ordinary support pipe, in the
-- same chat as every other message, with the conversation so far attached. The
-- owner checks the ID against the partner list on Deriv and answers /approve or
-- /decline. Approval mints a code here and posts it into that person's support
-- window; the code then unlocks the download.
--
-- `visitor_id` is the random string minted in the visitor's own browser — the
-- same key support conversations already use. It is what binds a code to one
-- person: a code pasted by anybody else is refused, which is the whole point of
-- issuing one.
--
-- `answered_at` is the third way a request stops waiting. /approve and /decline
-- decide it; replying to the person by hand takes it out of the queue WITHOUT
-- deciding it, because most conversations are handled by talking. Status still
-- says what was decided, if anything.
--
-- RLS is ON with NO policies, which denies everything. Nothing here is
-- reachable from a browser — the only doors are the functions under /api/mt5,
-- and they hold the service key.
