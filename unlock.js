/**
 * EVIE — practice mode.
 *
 * A mode the dashboard does not advertise. Three clicks on the "o" of Home
 * open a bare field; the right phrase turns the mode on and is remembered on
 * that device for good. From then on the same three clicks toggle it, and the
 * only thing the screen ever says about it is a one-second flash on the word
 * Home.
 *
 * ── Where the state lives ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * localStorage, not sessionStorage. The rule is that switching it on survives a
 * refresh, a closed tab and a closed browser — the only way out is the same
 * three clicks that let you in. sessionStorage would have quietly dropped it on
 * every tab close, which is the one behaviour explicitly not wanted.
 *
 * There is no server and no sync. A second device is a second first time: the
 * phrase is entered once there too, and then that device remembers as well. The
 * Deriv account ids that unlocked here are recorded alongside, so the record
 * says who did it and not only that somebody did.
 *
 * ── On the phrase check ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The phrase is compared as a hash so it is not sitting in the bundle as a
 * readable word. Be clear about what that is worth: this runs in the browser,
 * so anyone who opens devtools and reads this file can work out how it is
 * checked. It keeps the door shut against somebody idly poking at the page. It
 * is NOT security, and nothing behind it is treated as if it were — practice
 * mode only ever swaps which page a tile opens.
 *
 * ── The naming ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No identifier, key or string in this file says what the mode is for. That is
 * deliberate: the storage keys read like interface preferences because a
 * curious person's first move is to open Application → Local Storage.
