/**
 * EVIE — the terminal's market data.
 *
 * Every price on every screen comes from Deriv, over the public market socket:
 *
 *     wss://api.derivws.com/trading/v1/options/ws/public
 *
 * No OTP, no token, no account. That matters more than it sounds: an earlier
 * draft of this file went through the connected account's trading socket,
 * because the older API's tick stream carried a single `quote` and no sides,
 * and because the endpoint it used refuses an OIDC app id. Both problems belong
 * to that older API. This one hands over a real `bid` and a real `ask` on every
 * tick, to anyone, unauthenticated — so the terminal shows the actual market
 * whether or not anybody has connected anything.
 *
 * What arrives, and what is done with it:
 *
 *   · `active_symbols` names the instruments and gives each one its pip size.
 *   · `ticks` streams bid, ask and quote. The engine takes those unaltered;
 *     nothing about a price is modelled here or anywhere else.
 *   · A daily candle gives each row its true open, low and high.
 *   · Five-minute candles feed the chart, and `ohlc` keeps the last one live.
 *
 * The one thing Deriv does not have is a lot size — that is an MT5 notion with
 * no field in this API — so contract sizes are assigned by instrument below and
 * are the only assumption left in the whole price path.
