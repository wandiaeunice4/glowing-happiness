/**
 * EVIE — the trading simulator.
 *
 * It fills the account: a run of finished trades in the history, and a set of
 * positions left open on the Trade screen. What it does NOT do is invent a
 * market. Every price is the instrument's real bid or ask, live from Deriv, and
 * every size and charge comes from Deriv's own published contract specification.
 * Only the outcome is simulated — which trades won, which lost, by how much —
 * so only the balance, the deposit and the history are made up.
 *
 * The open positions are not scripted at all. They are opened at the live price
 * and then left alone, so their profit is the engine's own arithmetic against
 * the tape and moves while you watch it, exactly as a real one would.
 *
 * Costs:
 *
 *   · Swap is the instrument's own published rate in points per lot per night,
 *     charged only for nights actually held and tripled on Wednesday, the night
 *     whose value date lands over the weekend under T+2. Signed as Deriv writes
 *     it, so a gold short is credited where a long is charged.
 *   · Commission is a setting, per lot per round turn, because it depends on
 *     the account and not on the market: Deriv's Standard MT5 account is
 *     zero-commission, while its Zero Spread account charges one. It defaults to
 *     zero for that reason and is applied to every trade when set.
 *   · The spread is never simulated. A position opens at the ask and is valued
 *     at the bid, and both are the live figures.
 *
 * The balance is a target, not an outcome. Deposit and balance are both set, and
 * the run's results are scaled so it lands exactly on the balance asked for —
 * otherwise the field would be decoration, which is what it was.
