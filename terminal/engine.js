/**
 * EVIE — the terminal's account.
 *
 * A MetaTrader 5 account with nothing behind it but this file: no Expert
 * Advisor, no broker, no socket. Prices are generated here, orders are filled
 * here, and the money is a number in localStorage.
 *
 * It is written to behave the way MT5 actually behaves rather than the way a
 * mock usually does, because the arithmetic IS the product here — somebody
 * learning the platform on this should not have to unlearn anything when they
 * open the real one:
 *
 *   · A buy fills at the ASK and is valued at the BID; a sell is the reverse.
 *     That is why every position opens showing a small loss, which is the
 *     spread, and it is the first thing a new trader asks about.
 *   · Profit is (close - open) x volume x contract size, signed by direction.
 *   · Equity is balance plus floating profit. Free margin is equity minus
 *     margin. Margin level is equity over margin as a percentage, and it is
 *     blank rather than infinite when nothing is open.
 *   · Stop loss and take profit are checked against the price the position
 *     would CLOSE at, not the one it opened at.
 *
 * Everything persists. Positions survive a reload the way they survive closing
 * the app on a phone, and prices carry on from where they were rather than
 * snapping back to a seed.
