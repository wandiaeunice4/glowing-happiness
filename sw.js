/**
 * EVIE — the service worker.
 *
 * Fresh first, fast always.
 *
 * The old worker cached nothing: it existed only because Chrome will not offer
 * to install a site without a fetch handler. The reasoning was sound — a stale
 * shell talking to Deriv with settings the user cannot see is the one failure
 * that matters — but the cost showed up on the launch screen. With nothing
 * cached, opening the installed app meant downloading the whole page over
 * whatever network the phone had before a single pixel could be painted, and
 * on a slow one Android gave up and called it "not responding".
 *
 * So: every request still goes to the network FIRST, and a fast connection
 * gets exactly what it got before — the latest build, nothing served from a
 * cache. What changes is what happens when the network is slow. After a short
 * wait the cached copy is served instead, so the app paints in a couple of
 * seconds rather than never, and the fresh copy — when it does arrive — is
 * stored for next time. One session on the previous build, on a bad
 * connection, beats a launch screen that hangs.
 *
 * The shell is put in the cache at install, so even the first launch after
 * installing has something to fall back on. Images and icons are cache-first:
 * they do not change, and refetching a logo on every launch is waste. Nothing
 * under /api is ever cached, and neither is any other origin.
