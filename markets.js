/**
 * EVIE — the volatility markets rail.
 *
 * Five minutes of price movement for every Deriv volatility index, live: a
 * sparkline of the window and the percentage it moved across it.
 *
 * The data comes over the same OTP socket the bot trades on, because that is
 * the only socket these credentials can open — the plain ws.derivws.com endpoint
 * refuses an OIDC app id (see deriv.js). One socket serves every market:
 * `ticks_history` with subscribe:1 returns the window once and then streams each
 * new tick, so the rail stays current without polling.
 *
 * Every figure is computed from real ticks. The change is the last price against
 * the first price INSIDE the five-minute window, and old ticks are dropped as
 * they age out, so what is on screen is always the last five minutes and never a
 * widening average.
